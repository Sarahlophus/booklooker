## Project Description

This website features a simple book search engine where users can search for books, and create an account to save books to their personal profile for later reference. Utilizes MERN stack.

This application originally featured a Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, but has been refactored to utilize a GraphQL API with an Apollo server.
